Chat Room Application with Multirooms:
 - Server: Node.JS/Express/Socket.IO
 - Client: Jquery / Emojii Plugin
 - No NPM modules included, pls see package.json for modules needed
 - Server code has  number of console.logs left.  They give good visbility into the way server works, comment those off as you wish....
 - Multi-room is a poor man's implementation.  In a nutshell it doesn't fetch the history per room on a new client load.
